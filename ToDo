EMS Version 2 Update/ Improvement
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(1) Under Received Invoices, SAC/ HSN should be manual, because we cannot predict all purchase bills from different sellers. 
Once the SAC/ HSN number is entered, next time, it should appear in auto populate
Mention only files changed, including path. (completed)

(2) Create Invoice: Price should also accept decimal. (completed)

(3) Create Employee: Add another mandatory field called "Max. Qualification". (completed)

(4) All dates, should be in Indian format i.e., dd/mm/yyyy

(5) When we create a foreign client (say) US, there is no option for entering State in the Create Client form. But when invoice is generated, it shows the State as Address of the client.

When client is foreign, there should be another input box called “State” in the Create Client form. The State field is not mandatory. Whatever, Admin enters in State, should appear exactly in the invoice. If no state is entered, than State should be empty/ blank in the invoice.
(completed)

(6) GST Issue - When you search for GST, only GENERATED GST. You can’t download XCEL or PDF. On the contrary, if you view the Current GST and Click on Generate GST, after GST is generated, the Download links for XCEL and PDF works fine.
(completed)

(7) Invoice MAJOR ISSUE - We have to provide Edit facility for any invoice that is unpaid. An invoice may not even be paid by customer, hence we should have facility for a Credit Note.
(partially completed that is Credit Note part left)
